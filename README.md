# graphql-go

> GraphQL implemented in Go

## Notes

This project is based on [GraphQL JavaScript](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) implementation.

This project is **in development and not ready yet**. At this time, it can only execute the simplest query. See [examples/hello.go](https://github.com/ng-vu/graphql-go/blob/master/examples/hello.go).

## Install & run

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org) installed and `$GOPATH` set up properly.

```
go get github.com/ng-vu/graphql-go

cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ng-vu/graphql-go
go run examples/hello.go
```
